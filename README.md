# Customer Churn Classification

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector using machine learning classification models.  
The dataset includes demographic, account, and service-related information such as:

- Gender  
- Senior citizen status  
- Contract type  
- Payment method  
- Internet services  
- Monthly charges, tenure, and total charges  
- Customer churn status (Yes/No)  

The goal is to classify customers into two groups:
- **Churn (Yes):** customers likely to leave.  
- **No Churn (No):** customers likely to stay.
