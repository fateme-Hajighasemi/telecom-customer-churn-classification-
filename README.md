# Customer Churn Classification

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications sector using machine learning classification models.  
The dataset includes demographic, account, and service-related information such as:

- Gender  
- Senior citizen status  
- Contract type  
- Payment method  
- Internet services  
- Monthly charges, tenure, and total charges  
- Customer churn status (Yes/No)  

The goal is to classify customers into two groups:
- **Churn (Yes):** customers likely to leave.  
- **No Churn (No):** customers likely to stay.

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle categorical and numerical features  
   - Deal with missing values & outliers  
   - Feature encoding and scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing churn patterns  
   - Identifying correlations between features  

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree / Random Forest  
   - XGBoost or other advanced models  

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
   - Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC
